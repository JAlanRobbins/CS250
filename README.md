 - How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
 
In order for developers to understand user needs it is necessary to get feedback from the users about features and 
updates that they look for in the software. Usually this would be done with interviews where the key points the users 
look for are summarized and then given to the developers. The “User Stories” are basically this summation and keep 
the developers from directly interacting with the user so that they can focus on development instead of user interaction.  

 - How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

How I usually develop programs is with a clear outline of what I want to happen with the program. 
I break down the features that I am looking for and describe how I can integrate them. 
Usually I would describe my development as a waterfall methodology where I try to pre plan everything. 
If I had to take anything away from Agile I think that it would benefit me the most to try and work in Sprints, 
where I am constantly reviewing and re-planning my sprints instead of trying to complete a project and then test it. 

 - What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that there are multiple things that you need in order to be a good team member in software development.
I think that one of the most important traits to have when you are on a team is to have good communication. 
When you withhold information that the team needs or you neglect to reach out to team members when you properly need help on a particular problem, 
you are only hurting the progress of the project. 
Also I think another thing that can also be gotten from that is that a good team member knows their limitations. 
If you are faced with a problem that you are not used to solving or stuck, it is better to ask a senior to help you than 
to just stare at the problem thinking that you are the only one that can solve it when in reality, 
there are other team members that have already solved that problem multiple times over.
